Teacher training is exciting, rewarding...and yes, can be a busy time! Between lesson planning, teaching, and assignments, it can feel like you’re  juggling a lot! 

The key is smart time management, so you can maintain a healthy work-life balance and  be well prepared for your teaching career. It is also important to remember that not everything will work for you- it's good to try out a few different approaches to see what works.

## Tips from past trainees (they've been there!)

### Good time management practices

    text: "Your work will take as long as you allow it to take. Try setting a timer for yourself to complete a certain task, and you would be surprised at how much more efficient you become.",

<%= render Cards::QuoteComponent.new(
    text: "I think striking the balance between work and teaching was quite difficult. In the end, I made sure that during each of my free periods, I knew exactly what I wanted to get done. I also made sure that I left school early every Wednesday and did no work at home. At the weekends, I did my work on a Sunday rather than Saturday because it meant things wouldn't spill over to the next day.",

### Time management tools

    text: "Have a teaching diary! It kept me on top of plans, clubs, fixtures, general life and honestly was the best tool I could use.",

<%= render Cards::QuoteComponent.new(
    text: "Excel spreadsheet for medium term planning - lifesaver! A sheet for each term, scheme of work, calendar for the year and a to do list. So useful!.",

) %>

### Be organised (future you will thank you)

<%= render Cards::QuoteComponent.new(
    text: "Organisation will make the process so much easier! Being organised with what you need in and out of the classroom helps you be more efficient with your time. This directly leads to having a proper work life balance because you won’t have to do things on weekends or late after school. It’s an intense process so being organised and making sure you have time for yourself is the most important thing.",

<%= render Cards::QuoteComponent.new(
    text: "Be organised. Have a filling system for your notes, lesson plans and resources. It is the most annoying thing when you know you have a fantastic resource and can't find it because you can't remember where you've saved it.",

### Ask for support (and don’t struggle in silence)

<%= render Cards::QuoteComponent.new(
    text: "Make sure you prioritise your jobs and be open/honest with your mentors/host teachers if you are struggling with time frames etc.",

<%= render Cards::QuoteComponent.new(
    text: "AI became a big help when it came to planning activities. Use it to take some of the more time-consuming tasks away. AI is not there to teach, it is there to help you teach.",
