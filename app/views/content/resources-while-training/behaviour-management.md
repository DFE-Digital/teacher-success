Learning how to manage behaviour in a classroom will be a key part of your teacher training.

But don’t worry – your provider and placement schools will work together to teach you different techniques and practices and will be there to provide support and advice for any challenges you face.

## Things to consider
Each school will have its own behaviour management policy so it’s important to check what your school has in place.

When you start your placement, you might want to consider if you know:

- what your school’s behaviour management policy is
- how to record and share good behaviour and achievements
- how to report a behaviour incident and implement any sanctions for challenging behaviour – will you need access to any systems to do this?
- if there are any children in your class with special educational needs or disabilities (SEND) or a behaviour support plan and how you will be expected to support them

## Behaviour management resources
You can <%= govuk_link_to "read the Department for Education’s trainee teacher behavioural toolkit", "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/initial-teacher-training-itt-core-content-framework/the-trainee-teacher-behavioural-toolkit-a-summary" %>.

The important thing to remember is that no technique is universal. Different things will work in different situations.

If you find that what you’re implementing is not effective, talk to your mentor and tutor about other alternatives.
