Your school-based mentor plays an important role in your development as a teacher. They help you meet the standards that will lead to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS), which is the accreditation you need to teach in England. They’ll do this by supporting your progress, offering feedback, and helping you reflect on your practice. 

Building a strong professional relationship with your mentor can make a big difference to your placement experience. To get a head start, it’s a good idea to already have an idea about how you learn and how you’d like to receive feedback.

## Professional relationship

Your school-based mentor will support you, but they’re also a teacher with a busy schedule. Don’t worry, though, there are simple things you can do to make the most of your time together:

* start with enthusiasm: a positive mental attitude and a genuine willingness to learn go a long way
* be proactive: ask your mentor if there’s anything they need from you or if there’s anything you can do to help- showing initiative helps to build trust
* be understanding: they’re there to support you, but they have other responsibilities and commitments and, like you, are juggling them all

## Your time with your mentor

Your time with your mentor might include formal meetings, catch-ups and lesson observations. It can vary depending on your subject, school, and stage of training. 

To get the most out of it:

* bring notes or questions from your training experiences
* be ready to discuss what went well and what you found challenging
* stay open to feedback- it's all part of the process, even when it stings a little
  
## Receiving feedback

Feedback helps you grow, but it can be a challenge to feel that in the moment. That’s totally normal. The trick is to treat it like a gift and don’t worry if this takes time! 

While you’re receiving the feedback, you can try to:

* listen carefully and try not to become defensive
* ask questions if you don’t understand something or if it isn’t clear
* write important comments or tips down so you can visit them later

After you’ve received your feedback, you could:

* reflect on it after having some time to decompress
* think about ways you can try to apply it
* ask further questions if you have any
* celebrate your wins! Progress is progress, even if it’s just getting through something you’ve found challenging
